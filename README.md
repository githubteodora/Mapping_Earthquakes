# Mapping_Earthquakes

A fun project that uses JSON GeoData, JavaScript (D3 and Leaflet libraries), CSS and HTML to visualize earthquakes that took place in the past 7 days. 
The output is an interactive maps with 3 styles and 3 overlay layers, which allow the user some control over the visualization.

# Further project development ideas:
 - check if the data for the past 100~200 years is available online;
 - if so, analyze the data to spot areas with major earthquakes and when the was the last time a major earthquake happened (define major);
 - identify if there is a noticeable repreat pattern;
 - try to predict when major earthquakes are most likely to occut in the next 5-10 years; 
 - visualize earthquake prodecition hotspots;
